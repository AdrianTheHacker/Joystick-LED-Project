# Wiring
Joystick:
    1. Wire the ground pin of the joystick to the ground of the arduino
    2. Wire the positive pin of the joystick to the 5 Volts of the arduino
    3. Attach VRX (the pin that is used to record the angle of the X axis) to pin A0
    4. Attach VRY (the pin that is used to record the angle of the Y axis) to pin A1

LED:
    1. Place 9 LEDs in a 3x3 grid:
        LLL
        LLL
        LLL
    2. Wire anodes of the LEDs to pins 3-10
    3. Wire cathodes to ground in series with a 330ohm resitor
